# Week 1 Toy Problems 

## Author
Edith Thaba

This repository contains JavaScript solutions for three toy problems related to student grades, speed detection, and net salary calculation.

## Prerequisites

1. Create a repository on your GitHub account.

   - Ensure that the repository has one folder for each solution and that each solution is contained in 3-4 files.
   - Each file should only hold one solution.

2. Use JavaScript to implement the solutions.

3. Push the solutions to the repository.

4. Submit the repository link for grading.

5. Ensure your repository has a well-written README.

## Challenges

### Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem)

Write a function that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. The output should correspond to the correct grade:

- A > 79
- B - 60 to 79
- C -  59 to 49
- D - 40 to 49
- E - less than 40

### Challenge 2: Speed Detector (Toy Problem)

Write a program that takes the speed of a car as input. If the speed is less than 70, it should print "Ok". Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

- Example: If the speed is 80, it should print: "Points: 2". If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: "License suspended".

### Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator (Toy Problem)

Write a program to calculate an individualâ€™s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. Calculate payee (Tax), NHIF Deductions, NSSF Deductions, gross salary, and net salary.

- Use KRA, NHIF, and NSSF values provided in the link below.

## Running Instructions

To run the JavaScript files, ensure Node.js is installed on your machine. 

 ### How to Use

1. Open the `net_salary_calculator.js` file in a JavaScript
2. Run the program.
3. Follow the prompts to enter your basic salary and benefits.
4. node filename .js will make the program prompt you to enter your basic salary and benefits
4. The program will then calculate and display the Gross Salary, PAYE, NHIF, NSSF, and Net Salary.
5. The results will be displayed in the console.
